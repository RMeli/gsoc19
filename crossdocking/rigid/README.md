# Rigid Docking

Rigid docking of the same dataset used for flexible docking.

## Notes

The data set root folder changed name from `carlos_cd` to `wierbowski_cd`.

An additional change affecting the scripts is that the `PDB_Structures` folder is gone and therefore the different protein-ligand files are one level higher than in the previous version of the data set.
